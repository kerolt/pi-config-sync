# pi-config-sync

Securely sync your `~/.pi/agent` configuration across machines through a git remote — automatically, with hard guards that keep secrets out.
It is a [pi package](https://pi.dev/packages) and keeps the repository **in place** (`~/.pi/agent` *is* the repo) so its history stays transparent.

Fork of [diogovdias/pi-config-sync](https://github.com/diogovdias/pi-config-sync).

## Install

```sh
pi install git:github.com/kerolt/pi-config-sync
```

## Quickstart

On the first machine, run `/gitsync init`. With authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`), it detects your account, creates a private `pi-agent-config` repository, commits the allowed configuration, and pushes it.

Without `gh`, first create a private remote yourself, then run:

```text
/gitsync init git@github.com:you/pi-agent-config.git
```

On each additional machine, run `/gitsync link` (with `gh`) or `/gitsync link <remote-url>`. It fetches the remote configuration. A differing local allowed file is moved to `<file>.local-backup`; it is never deleted, and linking refuses to touch a directory that already has its own git history. Run `/reload` afterwards; local-only allowed files are committed and pushed by the next sync.

That is the whole setup — from here on, syncing is automatic.

## How it works

```text
session start    → auto-sync (rate-limited, default every 5 min across sessions)
                   ensure ignore rules → commit allowlisted changes → fetch
                   → fast-forward or rebase → push
                   → notifies you to /reload when remote changes were pulled
session shutdown → best-effort commit + push (next start reconciles the rest)
```

### Machine-local settings

`settings.json` uses a git clean/smudge filter: portable settings are committed, while each machine retains its own selected top-level values. By default this is `lastChangelogVersion`; machine values stay in your live settings file (mirrored to `.git-sync/settings.machine.json`) and are absent only from committed blobs. On an existing repository, the first sync after upgrading creates a one-time commit that strips those keys from the committed blob and normalizes JSON formatting — the live settings file is unchanged.

The filter is fail-open: a checkout on a machine without pi-config-sync still works, but its machine-local values are not stripped until the package runs again. A newly linked machine gets its sidecar as pi writes its local settings.

The filter script runs under the Node.js that runs pi. When pi ships as a single bundled executable (for example through mise), that executable cannot run the script, so the package uses the first `node` found on `PATH` instead and falls back to a disabled filter with a warning. Set `nodePath` in `git-sync.jsonc` to pin a specific Node.js binary; the git filter configuration is corrected on the next sync.

Commits look like `pi config: auto-sync from <hostname>`. Concurrent pi sessions coordinate through a pid-liveness lock, subagent child processes never sync, and a diverged repo aborts the rebase and asks you to resolve manually — nothing is ever forced.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/gitsync init [name\|owner/name\|url]` | Create and connect the first-machine repository |
| `/gitsync link [name\|owner/name\|url]` | Connect another machine |
| `/gitsync status` | Show repository and tracked-secret status |
| `/gitsync sync` | Commit, fetch/rebase, and push |
| `/gitsync push` | Commit and push without pulling |
| `/gitsync pull` | Fetch and integrate remote changes |

## Security model

This package uses an **allowlist**, not a broad config-directory upload.

### What syncs

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | Model defaults, theme, installed package list — committed with machine-local keys stripped |
| `AGENTS.md` | Your global agent instructions |
| `extensions/`, `chains/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`, `skills/` | Your custom resources |
| `.gitignore`, `git-sync.jsonc` | The sync policy itself |
| `extraPaths` entries | Anything safe you add explicitly |

Nothing outside the allowlist ever syncs — new files are ignored by default. Subdirectories of allowed directories sync at any depth, with two exceptions that sync and `/gitsync status` warn about: a directory that is itself a git repository (a cloned extension) is skipped, so remove its inner `.git` to sync its files; and a path whose name matches the denylist below (such as `extensions/token-counter/`) is skipped, so rename it.

### What never syncs

| Path / pattern | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `auth*` (`auth.json`) | API keys and OAuth tokens |
| `*token*`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`, `*.env*`, `*.local.json` | Anything named like a secret |
| `sessions/`, `state/`, `.git-sync/` | Local history and machine state |
| `logs/` at any depth | Runtime logs, including permission audit/debug logs; retained locally |
| `npm/`, `git/`, `bin/`, `node_modules` | Installed packages — pi reinstalls them from `settings.json` |

The policy is enforced four ways — a managed allowlist `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, a post-stage hard guard that refuses additions or changes to denied paths, and a push guard that checks the committed tree and outgoing history — so force-staging a denied path does not bypass the commit guard. Deletions remain allowed for cleanup. It never force-pushes.

Ignore rules do not untrack existing files. Use `git rm --cached -- <path>` to stop tracking a log while retaining the local file. A later deletion does not remove that log from earlier commits: the push guard also checks commits not reachable from locally known `origin` remote-tracking refs, including on initial and shutdown pushes. Unpushed history containing denied paths must be cleaned before retrying. The package does not rewrite history or revoke exposed credentials. These are path-based checks, not a content secret scanner.

Git commands operate only on the agent directory's own repository — `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` stops git from ever discovering a parent repository (such as dotfiles in `$HOME`), and sync refuses to run until `~/.pi/agent/.git` itself exists. GitHub CLI calls are account-level (`gh api user`, `gh repo view/create`) and never modify repository contents. Use a private repository. When `gh` can identify a public GitHub remote, the package warns; it does not block because no credentials are synced.

## Configuration

Create `~/.pi/agent/git-sync.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "autoSyncIntervalMinutes": 5,
  "includeHostname": true,
  "extraPaths": ["my-safe-directory"],
  "warnOnPublicRemote": true,
  "machineLocalSettings": ["lastChangelogVersion"],
  "nodePath": "/usr/local/bin/node"
}
```

Unsafe extra paths (secrets, cache names, absolute paths, or `..`) are rejected. Set `includeHostname` to `false` to omit the machine hostname from automatic commit messages. `machineLocalSettings` replaces the default list when set; it accepts top-level keys only, and `[]` disables stripping (the filter still normalizes committed JSON formatting). Useful candidates include `shellPath`, `externalEditor`, `npmCommand`, `sessionDir`, and `trackingId`. `nodePath` is optional and only needed when pi runs as a bundled executable and Node.js is not on `PATH`, or to pin a specific interpreter for the `settings.json` filter.

## Conflicts and uninstall

On a sync conflict, rebase is aborted and the repository is left untouched for manual resolution:

```sh
cd ~/.pi/agent
git status
git pull --rebase
```

Remove the package with `pi remove git:github.com/kerolt/pi-config-sync`. Your local repository and remote remain until you delete them yourself.

If migrating from a hand-rolled `extensions/git-sync.ts`, delete that file first to avoid duplicate `/gitsync` registration.

## Alternatives

- [`pi-git-sync`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-git-sync) — manual-first `/sync` with interactive conflict handling, including agent-assisted merges and force-push / hard-reset options.
- [`pi-sync-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-sync-config) — background sync through a separate staging clone, with `settings.json` machine-key stripping, SSH-only remotes, and fast-forward-only pulls.

pi-config-sync differs from both: your agent directory itself is the repository (transparent history, no copy step), sync is fully automatic, onboarding can create the private repo through `gh`, and no destructive git operation exists in any code path. All three register different commands and can coexist.
